Data structures - diffrent ways to catagorize data in memory.
Graph - a collection of nodes/vertices and edges.
trees - a collecton of nodes, with a root, depth, and height.
Algorithm - function that in a finite amount of steps goes from any state to an end state.
Traversals - diffrent ways to 'pass through' the data structure.
Sorting algorithms - diffrent ways to sort information. depending on the language and the data itself, some sorting algorithms are more appropriate.
Time complexity - functions describing how much more compute power, thus, more time, follows proportionally to the amount of elements as the grow bigger.
Space complexity - the space needed for the algorithm to run.
